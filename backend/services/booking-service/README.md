# Booking Service

RoadScanner's booking orchestration layer — the platform's only source of truth for booking
records, composing catalog facts from `inventory-service` with live provider actions from
`provider-integration-service` into the booking lifecycle. See
[`docs/services/booking-service/overview.md`](../../../docs/services/booking-service/overview.md)
and the rest of that directory — frozen after two architecture reviews — for the full design.

**Status: feature-complete for Phase 1.** Domain, application use cases, persistence
(Postgres/Flyway, optimistic locking), JWT-verified REST API (RFC 7807 errors, OpenAPI), Kafka
inbound (`inventory-service`'s `TripCancelled`, `provider-integration-service`'s audit topic,
`payment-service`'s payment events) and outbound (`booking-events`) adapters are all implemented.
Two upstream dependencies (`operator-service`, `payment-service`) don't exist yet — see
"Remaining Integration Points".

## API Surface

Client-facing, under `/api/v1/bookings` (JWT bearer auth required — see `/swagger-ui.html` for
the full contract):

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /trips/{tripId}/seats` | Seat-selection view — static layout + live status, composed |
| `POST /holds` | Hold seat(s) for a trip (`TRAVELER` only) |
| `DELETE /holds/{seatHoldId}` | Release a hold before booking (idempotent) |
| `POST /` | Create a `PENDING_PAYMENT` booking against a held reference |
| `GET /{bookingId}` | Get a booking — ownership-checked (404, not 403, when denied) |
| `GET /?tripId=` | List bookings for a trip (`OPERATOR`/`ADMIN`/`SUPPORT`) |
| `GET /?onBehalfOfTravelerId=` | List another traveler's history (`ADMIN`/`SUPPORT` only) |
| `GET /` | List the caller's own booking history |
| `POST /{bookingId}/cancel` | Cancel a booking (idempotent) |
| `GET /{bookingId}/ticket` | Download the confirmed e-ticket |

Internal, service-to-service only, under `/internal/api/v1/bookings` (no auth in Phase 1 — see
"Remaining Integration Points"):

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /verify?travelerId=&tripId=` | Does a verified, `COMPLETED` booking exist — backs FR-7.2, consumed by `review-service` |

## Requirements

- Java 21
- Docker (for local Postgres/Kafka via `docker-compose.yml` at the repo root, and for
  Testcontainers-backed integration tests). No Redis — this service uses none.

No local Maven install required — use the wrapper (`./mvnw`).

## Running Locally

```bash
# from the repo root: start this service's Postgres, plus the shared Kafka
docker compose up -d postgres-booking kafka

# from this directory: run the app natively against them
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
```

The app starts on `:8085` with the `local` profile, expecting `inventory-service` (`:8084`) and
`provider-integration-service` (`:8083`) to already be running natively. It also expects a valid
JWT bearer token on every `/api/v1/bookings/**` request — one issued by a locally-running
`auth-service` works as-is; see "JWT Verification in Local Development" below.

### JWT Verification in Local Development

`application-local.yml` carries `auth-service`'s **shared development public key** under
`roadscanner.security.jwt.public-key-pem` — the same fixed, non-secret RS256 key every locally-run
service verifies against, and whose private half only `auth-service` holds. A token minted by a
locally-running `auth-service` is therefore accepted here without any out-of-band setup.

This replaced `ephemeral-keys: true`, which generated an unrelated throwaway pair in each process:
login succeeded at `auth-service` and every call here returned 401, because no two services shared
key material. The flag is now absent rather than set to `false` — `JwtConfig` checks it *before*
the configured key, so leaving it on would silently win.

Deployed profiles are unchanged: the public key comes from the secrets manager, and a missing key
still fails startup.

### Running Fully Containerized

```bash
docker build -t roadscanner/booking-service .
docker run --network host -e SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=local -p 8085:8085 roadscanner/booking-service
```

(`docker-compose.yml` intentionally does not include `booking-service` itself — same rationale as
every other service's identical omission.)

## Building & Testing

```bash
./mvnw compile   # compiles cleanly
./mvnw test       # requires Docker running (Testcontainers — Postgres + Kafka)
./mvnw package    # builds the executable jar
```

`./mvnw test` runs the full suite: framework-free domain unit tests (`Booking`'s full state
machine — every transition in `booking-state-machine.md`, including idempotency — plus
`SeatHold`), application-layer tests against in-memory fakes and fully-configurable stub clients
(covering the "one passenger per held seat" validation, ownership/role authorization for every
port, the provider-confirmation-failure and late-payment-success edge cases, and the trip-
cancellation cascade), Kafka-listener dispatch tests, Testcontainers-backed integration tests for
both persistence adapters, `@WebMvcTest` controller tests authenticated via Spring Security
Test's `SecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors.jwt()`, and `BookingServiceEndToEndTest` driving the
full hold → create → get → ticket flow over real HTTP, with `inventory-service`/
`provider-integration-service` stubbed via an embedded WireMock server.

*(In the environment this service was built in, Docker was unavailable, so the 90 tests requiring
no Docker — domain, application-layer, Kafka dispatch, and the `@WebMvcTest` suite — were run and
pass; the 17 Testcontainers-backed tests (2 persistence adapter classes, 1 end-to-end class)
compile cleanly and fail solely with `Previous attempts to find a Docker environment failed` — no
other error — confirming they are blocked only by the missing Docker daemon, not by any code
defect. They follow the exact same `TestcontainersConfiguration`/`@ServiceConnection` pattern
every other service in this codebase already uses successfully in CI, so they're expected to pass
under normal Docker availability — run `./mvnw test` locally to confirm.)*

## Configuration Profiles

| Profile | Use | Datasource / Kafka / JWT / upstream services |
|---|---|---|
| `local` | Running on a developer machine | `localhost`, matching `docker-compose.yml`; ephemeral JWT keys (see above); `inventory-service`/`provider-integration-service` base URLs point at `localhost` |
| `dev` | Deployed dev environment | Every value from an env var, no hardcoded fallback — including the real JWT public key matching `auth-service`'s signing key |
| `test` | Test execution | Only non-infrastructure properties; datasource/Kafka come from Testcontainers via `@ServiceConnection`; ephemeral JWT keys with a matching test-only signer (`testsupport.security.TestJwtIssuer`) |

No profile is active by default — a missing profile should fail loudly, matching every other
service's convention.

## Architectural Decisions

**Booking Service is the sole orchestrator of Seat Hold, Booking creation, and Provider
Confirmation — verified explicitly during the pre-implementation architecture review.** The
client never calls `inventory-service` or `provider-integration-service` directly, at any point,
in any flow. The one place the client legitimately reaches a different backend service is
`payment-service` (submitting payment) — a documented, frozen platform decision
(`docs/architecture/booking-flow.md` step 3), not client-side orchestration of the booking outcome.

**`Hold Seats` is a separate client-facing step from `Create Booking`, deliberately.** FR-3.2
requires the hold to exist "during checkout" — the span of time the traveler spends entering
passenger details — not just at the instant of submission. This is also why `SeatHold` is a
separate, short-lived aggregate from `Booking`: a hold that's abandoned (FR-3.4) never becomes a
`Booking` row nobody would recognize as a real booking attempt.

**`Create Booking` validates a hold via a local `expiresAt` comparison, never a fresh call to
`provider-integration-service`.** That service has no read-only "get reservation status"
operation — `BlockSeat`'s own response already returns the TTL this service needs, captured on
the `SeatHold` (and carried onto `Booking` as `holdExpiresAt`) at hold time. This resolves a real
gap between `docs/architecture/booking-flow.md`'s literal wording ("a read call") and
`provider-integration-service`'s actual, frozen port set.

**Post-confirmation cancellation is refund-only — no provider-side reversal is ever attempted.**
`provider-integration-service` has no operation for reversing an already-confirmed booking
(`ReleaseSeat` only covers a still-`BLOCKED` reservation). Adding one would mean redesigning that
service's frozen contract, which was explicitly out of scope for this implementation. This is a
real, documented product limitation, not an oversight — see
`docs/services/booking-service/boundaries.md`'s "Known Gap: Post-Confirmation Cancellation" for
the full reasoning and the recommended follow-up (a future `CancelBooking` port).

**Only trips with a `ProviderMapping` can be held or booked.** A first-party
(`operator-service`-sourced) trip with no provider equivalent has no `providerType`/
`providerTripId` to call `BlockSeat`/`ConfirmBooking` with — `Hold Seats` fails validation with a
clear "cannot currently be booked" outcome for such a trip. This is a real, currently-unclosed
platform gap (first-party trips are searchable but not yet bookable), not a `booking-service`
defect.

**`operator-service` and `payment-service` dependencies use documented, conservative interim
adapters.** `operator-service` doesn't exist to answer cancellation-policy questions —
`DefaultOperatorCancellationPolicyClient` defaults to full refund eligibility, no fee (the safest
choice for the traveler). `operator-service` also can't verify trip ownership for `OPERATOR`
requesters — `DefaultOperatorTripOwnershipVerifier` fails closed (always denies), so operators
cannot yet use `List Trip Bookings` until this exists. `payment-service` doesn't exist to receive
refund requests — `NoOpRefundRequestAdapter` logs what it would have requested and returns; a
booking's own state transition is never blocked on this. All three adapters are one-line swaps
once the real dependency exists — none of their ports' shapes need to change.

**JWT verification mirrors `auth-service`'s own RS256 design exactly, structurally incapable of
issuing tokens.** `adapter.out.security.JwtDecoderKeyMaterial` only ever holds a public key,
loaded from `roadscanner.security.jwt.public-key-pem` — there is no code path in this service
that can hold or use a private signing key in production, matching `auth-service`'s own security
rationale: *"compromising a downstream service only exposes its ability to verify, never to
issue."* Authorization (ownership, role checks) is decided entirely within this service's own
application layer, against its own data — never via URL-level `hasRole()` rules beyond the
platform-wide "must be authenticated at all."

**No Redis.** Nothing in the frozen architecture docs mandates one — `SeatHold` rows are already
short-lived Postgres rows with a TTL-like `expiresAt` field, not a cache in front of anything.

**No `backend/shared-libs` dependency yet; no Lombok; `ddl-auto: validate` never `update`.** Same
conventions as every other service in this codebase.

## Remaining Integration Points

Implemented but awaiting other platform components or a deliberate operational decision (tracked,
not forgotten):

- **`operator-service` doesn't exist yet** — cancellation-policy lookup and operator trip-
  ownership verification both use the conservative interim adapters described above. See
  `docs/services/booking-service/boundaries.md`'s "Relationship to `operator-service`".
- **`payment-service` doesn't exist yet** — the full `PENDING_PAYMENT → CONFIRMED` flow, and
  refund requests, are built against `payment-service`'s documented (not yet real) contract.
  `HandlePaymentCompletedServiceTest` exercises this path fully against fakes; no real end-to-end
  payment flow can run until `payment-service` ships its own producer.
- **`SeatReleased` is consumed by design but not yet published** by
  `provider-integration-service`'s current implementation
  (`docs/services/provider-integration-service/events-published.md`). `Sweep Stale Holds`
  (a scheduled job) is the interim safety net.
- **No real, shared JWT key pair between `auth-service` and `booking-service` in local
  development** — see "JWT Verification in Local Development" above. Both services' `dev`
  profiles already source the real key material from environment variables, so this is a
  local-dev-only gap, not a deployed-environment one.
- **The internal `/internal/api/v1/bookings/verify` endpoint has no authentication** — matches
  `inventory-service`'s and `provider-integration-service`'s identical, disclosed `/internal/**`
  gap (relies on the private network boundary until `api-gateway` enforces that path is never
  routed publicly).
- **Testcontainers-backed test suites were not executed in the environment this service was
  built in** (Docker was unavailable there) — see "Building & Testing" above.
- **Custom Prometheus counters** (booking funnel conversion, cancellation-reason breakdown,
  support-flagged-booking count) — standard HTTP/JVM/Kafka-consumer metrics are exposed now via
  Micrometer; business-specific counters are a follow-up, not a correctness gap.
- **The transactional outbox pattern named in `docs/architecture/high-level-design.md` §6** is
  not implemented — this service's own state transitions are internally consistent (single-
  service Postgres writes), but the Postgres-write-then-Kafka-publish boundary is not yet
  atomic. Flagged in `docs/services/booking-service/boundaries.md` as explicitly out of scope for
  the architecture specification; a real gap to close before the `booking-service` ↔
  `payment-service` path needs saga-grade consistency.
- **`backend/shared-libs` adoption** — unchanged from the bootstrap decision above.

## Package Structure

Hexagonal architecture — see
[`docs/services/booking-service/domain-model.md`](../../../docs/services/booking-service/domain-model.md)
and [`boundaries.md`](../../../docs/services/booking-service/boundaries.md) for the full
rationale.

- `domain/` — models (`Booking`, `SeatHold`, `Passenger`, `Ticket`, `RequesterContext`, ...),
  ports (`in`/`out`), exceptions (framework-free)
- `application/usecase/{hold,booking,cancellation,payment,trip,ticket,verification,scheduled}` —
  inbound-port implementations
- `adapter/in/event` — `TripCancelledListener`, `SeatReleasedListener`, `PaymentEventListener`
  and their wire messages
- `adapter/in/rest/{hold,booking,ticket,verification}` — controllers and DTOs, plus `exception/`
  (RFC 7807 global mapping) and `filter/` (correlation id)
- `adapter/out/persistence` — JPA entity/mapper/repo/adapter per aggregate
- `adapter/out/client` — `InventoryClientAdapter`, `ProviderIntegrationClientAdapter`, and the
  three interim adapters for not-yet-real dependencies
- `adapter/out/kafka` — the `booking-events` publisher
- `adapter/out/security` — JWT verification key material (`JwtDecoderKeyMaterial`,
  `EphemeralJwtKeyPair`)
- `config/` — Jackson, CORS, OpenAPI, persistence, Kafka, JWT/security, REST clients, use-case
  wiring, the two scheduled jobs
